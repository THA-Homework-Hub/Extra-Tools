## What is NotebookLM?

NotebookLM (by Google) is an AI tool that helps you study by summarizing documents, finding important quotes with sources, creating study questions, and letting you ask questions about your PDFs or notes.

---

## What you need

* A Google account with access to NotebookLM (availability varies by region and email provider).
* PDFs, lecture slides, notes, or textbooks.

---

## For Focused Learners 😇

NotebookLM helps you study smarter and understand better by letting you:

* **Get quick summaries:** Upload notes or chapters and ask for short summaries with key points and page numbers.
* **Ask specific questions:** Check things you don’t get by asking about tricky parts or important ideas.
* **Make study plans:** Create schedules and flashcards to help you review the stuff you find hardest.
* **Find exact quotes:** Upload textbooks you own and get the exact text with page numbers for essays or projects.
* **Explain tough stuff:** Turn hard paragraphs into easy step-by-step explanations or examples.
* **Keep your sources right:** Use the quotes and pages it gives you—but always double-check before you cite them.

Example prompt:

> “I uploaded *CourseText.pdf*. Give me a 200-word summary of Chapter 6, list 6 study questions with page numbers, and point out two places that need background knowledge.”

## For Time-Savers 😈

Sometimes stuff gets in the way and you gotta do what you gotta do! NotebookLM can help you finish work faster by:

* **Copying answers from whole textbooks**
  Upload books (like those in [Annes Archive](/Websites/Darksites/Annes-Archive/) and ask for direct answers without reading the book yourself. It even gives specific citations so you know exactly where the answers came from.

* **Rewriting text to avoid plagiarism**
  It can rephrase paragraphs so they don’t look like a direct copy. Great to avoid plagiarism, but not so great against AI checkers. See [GPTzero](/Websites/AI-Tools/GPTzero/) to avoid these.

* **Polishing and expanding your answers**
  Improve the wording of your work to make it seem more complete or professional. Useful if you have no clue what your talking about!

**Warning:** Using these shortcuts comes with risks. Always double-check your work and follow your school’s rules. Misusing these tools can lead to academic penalties or loss of learning. Use responsibly!

## How to upload / practical tips

* Drag-and-drop PDFs are supported. For very large files, split by chapter for quicker indexing.
* For scanned PDFs, run OCR first — selectable text yields far better results.
* Prompt example that balances speed and learning:

  > “Index the uploaded PDF and create 20 flashcards that test conceptual understanding (not just definitions). Include the source page for each card.”

---

## Example prompts (copy-paste)

* “Summarize Chapter 2 in 150 words and list 5 conceptual exam-style questions (with page refs).”
* “Find every occurrence of ‘X theory’ across the uploaded PDFs; return the surrounding 2 sentences and the page number.”
* “Create a 4-week study plan for this course, divide topics by difficulty, and include two practice problems per week.”
