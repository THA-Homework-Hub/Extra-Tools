# ChatGPT

**What it is**
ChatGPT is a conversational AI by OpenAI that helps explain topics, draft text, and generate examples.

**What you need**
- Account at https://chat.openai.com (free tier available).
- Modern browser.

**How to use for school (legit)**
- Ask for plain-language explanations, step-by-step walkthroughs, or example problems.
- Use it to brainstorm, outline essays, or generate practice questions â€” then verify facts and cite primary sources.

**How it could be misused (cheating)**
- Submitting AI-generated work as your own without understanding it is academic dishonesty. Use outputs as study aids only.
